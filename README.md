# Social-Network-API
UNC Chapel Hill Challenge 18

## Purpose:
To create a back-end API for a social networking web application. Allows users to store and retrieve data typical of social media networks including user data, posts, reactions, and friend lists. All data is provided by the user and no initially provided. The API utilizes a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM, as well as the Express.js server-side routing. All API testing was conducted using Postman.
